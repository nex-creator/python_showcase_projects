## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **Website structure differences**: Billboard‚Äôs HTML structure is different depending on the date and page, so selecting the right tags/classes required trial and error.
- **Data Not Found Errors**: Some elements were missing or returned `None`, leading to `AttributeError`.
  - Fixed by adding checks like `if element is not None:` before accessing `.text`.
- **Understanding CSS selectors vs tag-based navigation** in BeautifulSoup.
- Ensuring scraped song titles were clean and without unnecessary white spaces.
