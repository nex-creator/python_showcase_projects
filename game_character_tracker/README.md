# 🎮 Game Character Stats Tracker

## 📝 Description

**Game Character Stats Tracker** is a Python project that demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It allows you to create game characters, manage their stats (health, mana, level), level them up, and view their attributes in a structured format.  
This project is ideal for practicing **classes, properties, getters/setters, methods, and string representations** in Python.

## ✨ Features

- **Create a Game Character** with:
  - 🏷 Name
  - ❤️ Health (0–100)
  - 🔮 Mana (0–50)
  - 🎯 Level (starting at 1)
- **Update character stats** with automatic value capping
- **Level Up functionality**:
  - Increases level by 1
  - Resets health to 100 and mana to 50
  - Prints a level-up message
- **Display character stats** in a readable format

## 🧠 What I Learned

- 🐍 Python **Classes and Objects** – Creating and instantiating objects
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** – Using private variables and controlled access via properties
- ⚙️ **Getters and Setters** – Adding logic to safely modify attributes
- 🚀 **Methods and Behavior** – Implementing character leveling functionality
- 🖋 **String Representation** – Using `__str__` for readable object output
- 🛠 Debugging common errors like recursion in setters and proper attribute capping
