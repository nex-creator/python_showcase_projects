🐍 **Python Showcase Projects**

Welcome to my **Python Showcase Projects** repository!
This repository is a curated collection of Python projects that demonstrate my hands-on learning journey, problem-solving mindset, and practical experience across **automation, APIs, web scraping, backend development, and object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and includes:

- ✅ Clean, readable, and modular Python code
- 📝 A dedicated `README.md` explaining the project, design decisions, and learning outcomes
- 📦 `requirements.txt` for dependency management (where applicable)
- 🔐 Sensitive files such as `.env` excluded using `.gitignore`

| 🛒 **Amazon Price Tracker**          | Automates price tracking for Amazon products using web scraping. Sends alerts when prices drop below a defined threshold. Demonstrates automation, scheduling logic, and HTML parsing.                                      |
| ☕ **Cafe Listing Flask App**        | A lightweight Flask-based web application to list cafes with details such as location, amenities, and ratings. Demonstrates backend development, routing, templates, and CRUD-style design.                                 |
| 🎵 **Billboard Time Machine**        | Scrapes Billboard Hot 100 songs from a given historical date and creates a private Spotify playlist using the Spotify API. Demonstrates web scraping, API integration, and data transformation.                             |
| 📧 **Email Simulator (OOP Project)** | A console-based email system built to deeply understand Python OOP concepts such as class design, object composition, attribute chaining (e.g., `self.sender.name`), and real-world modeling of users, inboxes, and emails. |
